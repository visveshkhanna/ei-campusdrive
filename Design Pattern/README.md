In the Design Pattern folder, there are three folders for each of the design patterns namely Creational, Structural and Behavioural, along with two use cases for each of the same.

Each folder contains a README.md file which explains the design pattern along with the use case.

Every use case has a src folder which contains the code for the use case.

To run the code for the use case, run the following command in the terminal:
```bash
npm run build
```
```bash
npm run start
```
